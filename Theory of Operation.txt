Modular VFD Theory of Operation:

The concept behind the modular VFD boards it to hook up one PSU board and use it
to drive up to 10 IV-11 VFD digits. The boards use standard right angle 2.54mm (0.1")
headers and can be daisy-chained to meet the number of digits required.

PSU:

The PSU's main purpose is to generate all of the required voltage levels from a 12V input.
The rails generated are 28v for driving the grid and anodes (segments), a general purpose
5v rail (not used internally), a 3.3v rail for the microcontroller and I/O and the 1.5v rail
used by the heaters in the VFD digits.

The input is a 2.1x5.5(mm) center positive barell connector. The supply needs a 12v, 
2A input supply to run the all 10 digits and their 8 anodes (segments). It is connected
through a SMB reverse protection Schottky diode, and features 2 LEDs to indicate the
polarity of the input connection.

The microcontroller is a Microchip PIC16F15323 and is programmed via the pickit (3) ICSP
interface. It is a 3.3v microcontroller, and the GPIO is not 5v tolerant. If using an arduino
to interface with it, consider using a level shifter, a 3.3v zener clamp, or NPN or NMOS
transistors to pull the pins low. The ISCP header is the first 5 pins of the breakout header
which contains access to the IO pins and power rails. The breakout header also has 2.54mm
(0.1") spacing. The microcontroller is connected to 4 surface mount 6x6mm tactile buttons
labled on the board as T, A, +, -. It is intented to function as clock buttons but their
function may be changed in code. They utilize the pullups found in the PIC16F15323 and
thus are active low.

Digit Board:

Each board contains 2 2.54mm (0.1") headers for daisy chaining multiple segments, 
a 74HC595PW latched shift register (serial in, parallel out) and a TBD62783AFG high
side driver chip (8 channel). The shift register takes serial data from the mcu and drives
the inputs of the high side driver. The data stored in the shift register is latched to the
output on the rising edge of the latch signal so that the display data can be updated 
without seeing the data shift through the display. The serial output is connected to 
the SDO pin on the header, which mates with the SDI pin on the next digit.
